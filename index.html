  <h1>Clean My Walk List</h1>
	Do you work on a progressive campaign?
	Do you have a list of doors to knock or people to call?
  <p>Are you getting a lot of wrong numbers?  </p>
  <p>Are the addresses wrong?  </p>
  <p>Do you wish you had the cell phone numbers or email addresses of your voters? </p>
  	 
  <p>These are actually easy problems to fix.</p>
  <p>I worked in Hillary's analytics team in Detroit and worked with data vendors to update voter lists with the most current information. </p>
  
  <p>I want to help you do the same thing. </p>
